# Drac

Programming, motorsports, 3D modelling, cars, tech, music and TV :computer:.

Preferably all at once :thinking:.

- 📫 How to reach me: I am @Drac#9999 on Discord. You can find me messing around in [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming) (am also a staff member there), so join that and DM me from there as I probably won't accept a random friend request.
- 📖 High school student.
- 🌱 In love with Blender and DiscordKt. 
- 📘 Currently working on my blogfolio.
- 📔 Software of choice: VSCode/IntelliJ IDEA/Blender.
- 🖥️ Operating system: Windows 11 (+ WSL2, sometimes).
- 🎵 [My Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/16c8EwGMSEp9NSRW8uZOSL?si=41c4699d34754baa).
- ⌨️ [My blog](https://bush-car-dcc.notion.site/04baa12ee4aa4119aa9293ea4f5c2d77?v=5c9e4f3401914d48bc9cbc0e37f95b07) (you'll notice a great lack of creative skills)

If you want to check out my Blender escapades, I post my work on Instagram from time to time [@dracthedino](https://www.instagram.com/dracthedino/).
